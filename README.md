# Smart-Switch
I built a smart switch for my studio using an Arduino Uno. Here is the code and a few pictures. 

The switch has 3 modes: OFF, ON, and REC. 
In the "OFF" mode, it turns off both relays cutting off power everything but my computer. 
In the "ON" mode, it turns on both relays providing power to my speakers, monitors, and accessories. 
In the "REC" mode, it turns off one relay cutting off power to my speakers & fans while leaving on all other items so I can record in silence. 

Feel free to check out my pictures and video I uploaded in this repository.
